Hello my name is Georgi Zhizgov and my colleague and I are conducting a research for our shopping application based on different peoples dietary restrictions.
Can you introduce yourself? 
- Hello, my name is Radolina Petrova, I am 20-years old and I am currently studying at Fontys University as a Software Engineering student.
Do you have any dietary restrictions?
- Yes, I am a vegetarian.
And what motivated you to become one?
- Three years ago I did a research on vegetarians and I find more about how the meat is being produced so I decided to stop eating.
How do you currently find suitable food products to meet your dietary needs?
- It is kind of hard to find suitable products but I usually just go to supermarkets and they sometimes have separate sections for vegetarian products.
OKay, that's nice. What are the biggest challenges you face when trying to find suitable food products ?
- Well to find something with enough proteins maybe because since I don't eat meat I have to find another source for all the proteins I usually would get from meat.
I understand. And what features in an app that helps you find suitable products.
- Well, I would like to see maybe feature that allows me to Look through the supermarkets products and see like what's available at a which supermarket because most of the time when
 I go for a certain product I don't find it and it would be nice to see like which product are available at which store also maybe see Contents of the food and some more details about
 watching these products.
How how frequently do you see yourself using an app this.
- Several times a week, because I go shopping like almost every day I don't buy stuff for the whole week.
What types of food products are most important to you when you're looking for suitable food options?
- Well mainly Vegetarian meats and some replacement products of meat.
OK and how do you think an app like this could make your life easier as a vegetarian.
- Well I think it would really help me when trying to find some products I'm looking for.
Thank you very much for your help, that was really helpful. Hope to see you soon!
